# 🩺 Veterinary Nurse Overtime Analysis  

Have you ever tried to explain the problem with overtime at your job, only for your boss to come back with *their* statistics?  
Well… hit them back with even better ones.  

This project was created for a department manager at a veterinary clinic who wanted to understand the patterns behind her team’s overtime. To help her out, I built an **Excel tool** where she could enter shift data and instantly visualise trends. Once the data was filled in, I used it to perform the **analysis** and wrote the **final report** in Word (PDF version included).  

The goal was to find out **when overtime happens most often, and why** — uncovering structural patterns like heavy Monday evenings and the impact of unpredictable emergency work.  

## 🧠 What this project demonstrates  
- Data cleaning and organisation in Excel  
- Pivot tables and dynamic visualisations  
- Descriptive analysis and pattern detection  
- Report writing and interpretation of real workplace data  

## 🗂️ Files included  
- **Overtime_Analysis.xlsx** – interactive Excel file for data entry and visualisation  
- **Overtime_Report.pdf** – final written report with analysis, visuals, and recommendations  

✅ *Built entirely in Excel, analysed by me, based on real (anonymised) workplace data.*
